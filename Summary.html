<h3>Hi! I am Eliana Costa!</h3>
<h4>
Welcome to my profile! I am Eliana Costa, no.22 from F4D. I am currently still a high school student, who is still struggling with academic results.
</h4>
<h4>
I am also a part of the school's volleyball team. Although my skills are rubbish compare to other teammates, I still have fun and that's what matters!
</h4>
<h4>
I am also a member of Young Apostles'. Although sometimes I dislike going to meetings due to hunger, I still have fun.
</h4>
<h4>
Oh, and one more thing! I am actually a discipline prefect in school.

<h4>"Facing the real me.
I was scared all the time.
For someone who is perfect, not me.
I don't have to be anymore.
The lie is over." --Solitude Rain by Shizuku Osaka</h4>
